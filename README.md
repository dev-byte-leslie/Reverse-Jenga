# Reverse-Jenga

Reverse Jenga is a small game myself and 2 other students made to showcase physics programming skills. It includes implementation for the separating axis theorem of object collision, as well as physics calculations for various forces and impulses (like gravity) associated with colliding objects. 

The game works as follows: when the user clicks in the window the next shape is added to screen where the center of the object is added by the pointer. The shape can be various forms of a rectangle or triangle within acceptable sizes, as well as circles. the goal of the user is to get as many shapes to balance on each other as possible, without the tower falling down.
